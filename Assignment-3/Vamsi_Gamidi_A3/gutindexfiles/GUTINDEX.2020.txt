                           -=] INTRODUCTION [=-

GUTINDEX.2020 is a plain text listing of eBooks posted to the Project
Gutenberg collection between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020
beginning with eBook number 61070.

It is not a database, but it is useful for identifying eBooks so that they
can be downloaded or read online.


HOW TO GET EBOOKS FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG

The easiest and quickest way to obtain one specific eBook is via our search
page at

       https://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/search

where you can search by the eBook number for the particular book you want.

Other search engines at Project Gutenberg will provide you with more
information on more books by the same author using the same ebook
number, such as:

          https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/

or by author's name:

      https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/authors/a


ONLINE DATABASE

The online database can be accessed at

 https://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/


HOW TO DOWNLOAD AN EBOOK TO YOUR MOBILE DEVICE

If your device is Internet-enabled, just visit the catalog page for a book
and download one of the available formats that your device can display. If
your device is not Internet-enabled, then download to a computer and transfer
the book's file to your device using a USB cable or similar method. If your
device utilizes a different format from those available at Project Gutenberg
you will have to obtain an app to convert your ebook to your device's format.


SITE MAP

If you're interested, here is the Site Map to Project Gutenberg:

MIRROR SITES

Mirrors (copies) of the complete collection are available around the
world and you can select one nearer to your location from the link on the
search results page. However, if you have access to the world wide web
(www) the direct links above are much simplier.

To see a listing of mirror sites, and locate the one nearest to you,
visit:

  https://www.gutenberg.org/MIRRORS.ALL

Copy the URL of your choice and paste it in a new tab in your browser and
tap the Enter key on your keyboard.

PLAIN TEXT

Whenever possible, Project Gutenberg distributes a plain text version of an eBook
(.txt) in addition to several other choices. We stress the inclusion of plain
text because it is the lowest common denominator of formats and for its
longevity. Since Project Gutenberg began, dozens of widely used file formats have
come and gone, but the text format still remains. Text is accessible on all
computers and is insurance against future obsolescence.

The only times when Project Gutenberg distributes an eBook without a plain text
version are when plain text is impossible or impractical -- for example, for our
videos and MP3 audio files, and for some of our mathematical works.

     (Please note that files ending in .tex are mainly technical writings
      in TeX or LaTeX format, and should not be confused with text files.)


ZIP FILES

Files ending in .zip are compressed using the Zip method. This saves space
and should result in faster downloads. Many include images or support files.
Whenever practical, Project Gutenberg files are available as a zipped file.
These files will be found under More Files..." on the ebook download page.


CORRECTIONS

To report an error in the listings, please email to help2019@pglaf.org and
include the word CORRECTION in the subject line.


SUBMITTING NEW EBOOKS

If you are considering adding a new eBook to the Project Gutenberg
collection, Please make sure that any books you want to work on are _not_
already in the collection.  To see what is already online, refer to the
listing below.  Also, please be sure to check David Price's In Progress
list at:

  https://pglaf.org/~ccx074/gutip.html

to ensure no one is currently working on your selection.


COPYRIGHT CLEARANCE

It would also be helpful if you obtain copyright clearance prior to submitting
books. More information on this can be found at:

  https://www.gutenberg.org/


APPENDIX

Please see the Appendix at the end of each eBook catalog for some
general comments and clarification.
